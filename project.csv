4.Time to turn this tube into a bird feeder! Use a permanent marker to mark a line as wide as your popsicle stick onto one side of the tube. It’s best to keep this to the bottom of the bird feeder since it will be gravity fed. Use the craft knife and precision scissors to cut out that slit and make sure the popsicle stick fits through. Then mark a line directly across from this first one so that the popsicle stick will stick out from each side of the tube.
5.Cut a short triangle above the slit – this will let the bird seed very slowly pour onto the popsicle sticks for the birds to eat and peck at.
6.In the top lid of the tube, cut a piece of string and thread through the hole there to form a loop for hanging. If your container doesn’t have a hole, use a drill to make a small hole first.
